A small fluid simulator I built with Unity as a school project. Still contains a few bugs.

Built with Unity 2021.3.14f1

## Usage

All settings should be self-explanatory except:
- "Gauss Seidel Iterations": Decrease this to trade simulation accuracy for performance
- "CFL": Increase this to trade simulation accuracy for performance 

Exit by pressing escape.
